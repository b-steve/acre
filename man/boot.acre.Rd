\usage{
boot.acre(fit, N = 30, n.cores = 1, infotypes = NULL, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{an object generated by the modelling fit}

\item{N}{a numerical value indicates the number of iterations of the bootstrap process}

\item{n.cores}{a numerical value indicates the number of cores to be used. Currently this function doesn't support
parallel computing, so it is fixed to be 1.}

\item{infotypes}{a character vector contains the infotypes will be simulated in the additional bootstraps;
or a list with each element as a character vector, used for doing multiple additional
bootstraps with different settings of infotypes.}

\item{seed}{a numerical value indicates the seed for the randomness.}
