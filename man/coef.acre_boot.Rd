\arguments{
\item{object}{an object generated by the bootstrap function "boot.acre()".}

\item{types}{a character vector, the same as "coef.acre_tmb()".}

\item{pars}{a character vector, the same as "coef.acre_tmb()".}

\item{new_covariates}{a data frame, the same as "coef.acre_tmb()".}

\item{correct_bias}{logical. if TRUE, apply a bias correction method to the bootstrap results; otherwise,
return the original estimation directly. The bias correct method is
hat(coef) - (mean(boot_results) - hat(coef)).}
