\usage{
create.capt(
  captures,
  traps = NULL,
  ind.model = NULL,
  n.sessions = NULL,
  n.traps = NULL,
  mrds.locs = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{captures}{a data frame with capture data. Columns named "session", "ID" and "trap" are required, with
each row being regarded as one detection. Extra information can be provided as columns "bearing", "dist"
,"ss", "toa", "animal_ID". See 'Captures argument'.}

\item{traps}{a matrix or a data frame with two columns or a list of such matrices or data frames for a multi-session model.
Each row in a matrix/data frame provides Cartesian coordinates (in metres) for the location of a detector.
In a list of matrices or data frames, each element of the list corresponds to the detector location of a different session.
If the detector locations stayed the same across all sessions, only one matrix/data frame is required.}

\item{ind.model}{a logical value indicates whether to include individual identification which should be recorded as "animal_ID",
a column in the argument "captures". By default, it will be NULL, so the model will determine it automatically
depending on whether this information is provided in "captures".}

\item{n.sessions}{a numeric value denotes the number of sessions. It will only be used when the argument "traps" is not provided,
or it is a list with one element, or it is a data frame, or it is a matrix.}

\item{n.traps}{a numeric vector denotes the number of traps in each session. It will only be used when the argument "traps" is not provided.
If its length is 1, its value will be used for each session when we have multiple sessions. If its length is greater than 1,
the length of it must match the number of sessions.}

\item{mrds.locs}{a list with length of n.sessions with data frames or matrices as components, each data.frame or matrix
contains two columns record the Cartesian coordinates of each call. If a session has no detection,
keep the corresponding component as NULL. If animal.model, then each component must be a data.frame
with 4 columns: "animal_ID", "ID", "mrds_x" and "mrds_y".}
